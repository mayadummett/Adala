# Inspiration
In the summer of 2021, Maya conducted research into the intersection of computer science and political science for social good. In this, Maya focused on the how the United States government was using artificial intelligence in the administration and maintenance of social welfare services. Maya found that there was a need to create technology that supported the beneficiaries. So when Maya began Kode With Klossy in July of 2021, Maya proposed the idea of an app with centralized social welfare services to her fellow group members, Laila Khan and Ciara Rischert. Laila and Ciara were instrumental in building the initial vision of Adala with Laila deciding its name, Adala, meaning "justice" in Arabic. During three days of Kode With Klossy, Maya, Laila, and Ciara grew to love another as well as this work. In those three days, the group built a minimum viable product and after camp, the group decided to continue building (or coding) the vision of Adala.
